# Final Project
---
- ``Goal of the Project``: To predict If a customer would subscribe the marketing campaign of a Portugese Bank(Term Deposit) by building a supervised learning model(Random Forest with Hyper Parameter Tuning) and by this way reducing the costs. 
- ``Dataset``: UCI ML Repository. Data consists of 20 input features which are both numerical and categorical and related to customers and marketing campaign. Raw data has ~ 41k records. Marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, target variable represents if a customer subscribes a term deposit or not. 

- ``High-Level Planing``: 
  <p> Day 1: Data Exploration </p>
  <p> Day2: Data Processing and Feature Selection </p> 
  <p> Day3: Visualization </p>
  <p>Day4: Model Development</p>

  <p>Day5: Model Evaluation</p>
  <p>Day6: Model Deployment</p>
- ``Results``:
  
  Model is able to make a prediction with an 89% Accuracy and 88% Recall Score on Test Set.
